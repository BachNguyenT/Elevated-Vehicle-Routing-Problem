# Elevated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem
- A modified Vehicle Routing Problem where topographic characteristics of the operation area is accounted into the cost of each arcs, rather than assuming a flat routing area.
- Problem Formulation: minimize total cost (fuel consumption) of the operation subject to Classical VRP constraints as well as minimizing the net elevation traveled by the vehicle
- Restricted to non - regenerative vehicles only
- Graph previously formulated using real garbage collection operations (undisclosed)
- Coordinates for each node (customer address & depot) requested from Google Maps Geocoding API
- Direction between each node in the graph requested from Google Maps Direction API
- Elevation (with respect to sea level) requested from Google Maps Elevation API
- Solved using Python Pulp library for linear optimization, and Gurobi Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Optimization Solver using Branch & Cut Algorithm with Limited Time
- Feasible Solution found for 254 nodes with less than 4% gap using Intel Core i9 9980HK - 2.3GHz - 8 Core - 16 Threads - 16GB Ram
- Route, Nodes, and Depot visualized using matplotlib.pyplot
